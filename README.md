# Rio Grande Basin Population Aggregation
Code and pseudocode for aggregating Gridded Population Data across counties in the Rio Grande Basin

## Purpose
This code was created to automate the process of calculating the population in each county in the Rio Grande Basin, using the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 dataset. This was a part of a research project focused on the relationship between population density and water withdrawals in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin.

## Data 
This code was built to use the dataset created by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network based on population counts consistent with national censuses and adjusted to match United Nations country totals.

This code also utilized a feature class for each county in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin, compiled by Plassin et al. (2019) using data from the US Census Bureau and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía.
